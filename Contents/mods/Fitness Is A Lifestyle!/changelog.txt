Unstable changes:
V0.2.7:
    - Add Dynamic Traits to "compatibility"
    - Redone the amounts of XP given as there were errors.
    - Check to modify the MST addon when Prodigy from Dynamic traits is added, now it will also apply to Prodigy players
    - Check the CheckRegNum to not get active while you are doing exercise. Should not do it anymore.
    - Changed the way the XP was being subtracted to modify the base XP gains.
    - Optimized code.
    - Should work, and modify, any XP from Strength and Fitness given to give the modified value based on the XP base multipliers, if the option is activated.

TODO:
    - Add Realistic Growth to the XP base gain

Possible features:
    - Affect Sprint and agility based on the Fitness and Strength.
    - The lower the regularity of both, the higher the loss of XP in both (using CheckRegNum)
